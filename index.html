            <h2>Research Interests</h2>
            <p>I am generally interested in probability theory and computational statistics. Some clusters of research projects include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Markov chains in statistical physics.</li>
                <li>Markov chain Monte Carlo and related methods in computational statistics.</li>
                <li>Links between Random matrices, embeddings, and rankings.</li>
            </ul>
At the time of writing (Winter 2024), I'm also quite interested in work related to the statistical properties and robustness of unsupervised and semisupervised embeddings. I enjoy collaborating on applied problems in statistics and machine learning.

            <h2>Opportunities and Collaboration</h2>
Please reach out at: asmi28@uottawa.ca.
            <ul>
                <li> I have funding available for recruiting graduate students and postdocs, either as a sole supervisor in an area related to my previous interests or (even better) as a cosupervisor in an area connected to these interests.  I encourage prospective students to get in touch with current students if they are interested in attending uOttawa - if you tell me your interests, I will try to find somebody with similar interests to talk to. </li>
                <li> I am almost always interested in finding applied collaborations.</li>
                <li> Much of my research, especially on Markov chains and on statistical work with embeddings, is fairly accessible to undergraduates. If you are thinking of undergraduate research, please reach out with a quick description of your interests.</li>
